- filepath: /Users/despiegk/code/github/freeflowuniverse/herolib/lib/clients/openai

make a dense overview of the code above, easy to understand for AI

the result is 1 markdown file called codeoverview.md  and is stored in $filepath

try to figure out which functions are more important and which are less important, so that the most important functions are at the top of section you are working on

the template is as follows

```md
# the name of the module

2-5 liner description

## factory

is there factory, which one and quick example how to call, donâ€™t say in which file not relevant
show how to import the module is as follows: import freeflowuniverse.herolib. 
and then starting from lib e.g. lib/clients/mycelium would result in import freeflowuniverse.herolib. clients.mycelium

## overview

quick overview as list with identations, of the structs and its methods

## structs

### structname

now list the methods & arguments, for arguments use table

for each method show the arguments needed to call the method, and what it returns

### methods

- if any methods which are on module
- only show public methods, don't show the get/set/exists methods on module level as part of factory.


```

don't mention what we don't show because of rules above.

the only output we want is  markdown file as follows

===WRITE=== 
$filepath
===CONTENT===
$the content of the generated markdown file
===END===
