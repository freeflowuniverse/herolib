## Blank Actor Generation Example

This example shows how to generate a blank actor (unspecified, except for name). The generated actor module contains all the boilerplate code of an actor that can be compiled but lacks ant state or methods.

Simply run: 
```
chmod +x *.vsh
example_1.vsh
example_2.vsh
```

### Examples

There are two examples of blank actor generation. 
- `example_1.vsh` generates the actor from a blank specification structure.
- `example_2.vsh` generates the actor from a blank OpenAPI Specification.

<!-- TODO: write below -->
Read []() to learn how actor's are generated from specifications, and how the two example's differ.
