# Bizmodel Params

In this section we can find all the parameters for the bizmodel.

## how to use and read

The params are defined in the different instruction files e.g. revenue_params.md

Often you will see something like  `revenue_growth:'10:1000,20:1100'` this can be read as month 10 it 1000, month 20 its 1100.

The software will extrapolate.
