# Shebang

is the first line of a script, your os will use that one to get started.

for V we use

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S v -n -w -gc none -no-retry-compilation -cc tcc -d use_openssl -enable-globals run
```

- -w no warnings 
- -n ??? 

This one is the fastest way how to run scripts, but not meant to run long running items
