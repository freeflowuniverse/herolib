# Docusaurus Library Code Review

This document outlines potential issues and suggested improvements for the Docusaurus library.

## Critical Issues

1. **Unexpected Program Termination**
   - In `dsite.v` line 205, there's an `exit(0)` call in the `process_md` method.
   - This will terminate the entire program unexpectedly when processing markdown files.
   - **Recommendation**: Remove the `exit(0)` call and allow the function to complete normally.

2. **Function Signature Mismatch**
   - In `clean.v` line 6, the `clean` method requires an `ErrorArgs` parameter: `pub fn (mut site DocSite) clean(args ErrorArgs) !`
   - In `dsite.v` line 62, the function is called without arguments: `s.clean()!`
   - **Recommendation**: Either make the parameter optional or update all calling code to provide the required argument.

## General Improvements

1. **Incomplete Example**
   - The example file `docusaurus_example.vsh` is incomplete, only showing initialization.
   - **Recommendation**: Complete the example with site creation, configuration, and building/development operations.

2. **Commented Code**
   - There are several instances of commented-out code, such as in the `factory.v` file.
   - **Recommendation**: Either complete the implementation of these features or remove the commented code for clarity.

3. **Debug Statements**
   - The `process_md` method contains debug print statements (`println(myfm)` and `println(mymd.markdown()!)`)
   - **Recommendation**: Replace with a proper logging system or remove if not needed for production.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Some error handling could be improved with more descriptive error messages.
   - **Recommendation**: Add more context to error messages, especially in file operations.

5. **Documentation**
   - While the config structures have some documentation, many methods lack proper documentation.
   - **Recommendation**: Add proper V-doc style comments to all public methods and structures.

## Architectural Suggestions

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Consider providing a more fluent API for configuration, rather than requiring JSON file manipulation.

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - The factory pattern is well-implemented, but consider making dependencies more explicit.

3. **Testing**
   - No tests were found in the codebase.
   - **Recommendation**: Add unit tests for critical functions.

4. **Logging**
   - Replace direct console output with a proper logging system that can be configured based on environment.
