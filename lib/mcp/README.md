# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation

This module provides a V language implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/) specification. MCP is a protocol designed to standardize communication between AI models and their context providers.

## Overview

The MCP module implements a server that communicates using the Standard Input/Output (stdio) transport as described in the [MCP transport specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports). This allows for standardized communication between AI models and tools or applications that provide context to these models.

## Key Components

- **Server**: The main MCP server struct that handles JSON-RPC requests and responses
- **Model Configuration**: Structures representing client and server capabilities according to the MCP specification
- **Handlers**: Implementation of MCP protocol handlers, including initialization
- **Factory**: Functions to create and configure an MCP server

## Features

- Full implementation of the MCP protocol version 2024-11-05
- JSON-RPC based communication
- Support for client-server capability negotiation
- Logging capabilities
- Resource management

## Usage

To create a new MCP server:

```v
import freeflowuniverse.herolib.schemas.jsonrpc
import freeflowuniverse.herolib.mcp

// Define custom handlers if needed
handlers := {
    'custom_method': my_custom_handler
}

// Create server configuration
config := mcp.ServerConfiguration{
    // Configure server capabilities as needed
}

// Create and start the server
mut server := mcp.new_server(handlers, config)!
server.start()!
```
