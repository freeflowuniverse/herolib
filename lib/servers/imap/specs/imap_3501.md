The Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4 Revision 1 (IMAP4rev1) enables clients to access and manage email messages on a server, treating remote mailboxes as if they were local folders. This protocol supports operations such as creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; setting and clearing flags; parsing messages; searching; and selectively fetching message attributes and content. IMAP4rev1 is designed for single-server access and does not include functionality for sending emails, which is typically handled by protocols like SMTP.

## Introduction

IMAP4rev1 allows clients to interact with email messages on a server, providing functionalities similar to local email management. It enables seamless synchronization between clients and servers, facilitating both online and offline email access.

## Protocol Overview

IMAP4rev1 operates over a reliable data stream, typically TCP. Communication involves clients sending commands to the server and receiving responses. Servers can also send untagged responses to inform clients of real-time updates.

## Commands and Responses

- **Commands**: Issued by the client to perform actions like selecting a mailbox or fetching messages.
- **Responses**: Returned by the server to indicate the status of a command or to provide requested data.

Commands are categorized as follows:

- **Authentication Commands**: Manage client authentication.
- **Mailbox Commands**: Handle mailbox selection and status.
- **Message Commands**: Operate on messages within a mailbox.

## Mailbox Operations

Clients can perform various operations on mailboxes, including:

- **Create**: Establish a new mailbox.
- **Delete**: Remove an existing mailbox.
- **Rename**: Change the name of a mailbox.
- **Subscribe/Unsubscribe**: Manage mailbox subscriptions.
- **List**: Retrieve a list of mailboxes.
- **Status**: Obtain the status of a mailbox, such as message count.

## Message Operations

Within mailboxes, clients can:

- **Fetch**: Retrieve specific message data.
- **Search**: Find messages matching certain criteria.
- **Store**: Alter message attributes, like flags.
- **Copy**: Duplicate messages to another mailbox.
- **Expunge**: Permanently remove messages marked for deletion.

## Client and Server Responsibilities

- **Client**: Initiates commands, processes server responses, and maintains synchronization with the server.
- **Server**: Executes client commands, sends appropriate responses, and manages the state of mailboxes and messages.

## Security Considerations

IMAP4rev1 does not inherently provide encryption. It's essential to implement security measures such as TLS to protect data transmitted between clients and servers.
